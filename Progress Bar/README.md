## What i learn ? 

# HTML 

- Disabled for button
- Understand more about semantic HTML

# CSS 

- Use :before, undestand how to play with it
- work with var() for color

# JS

- discover index on forEach
- the method used on JS to play with currentIndex
- how to play with disabled with JS

# WHAT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME ? 

Hmm.. it's still difficult to have the right method, I go everywhere in JS and I code neatly and easily.

Still struggling to understand the call of a function in another, I understand each time, but I have trouble using it alone.

Some difficulties to still understand the use of the index in the forEach.
